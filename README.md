# Statistical_Data_Analysis (SDA)

## Project Description:

This project analyzes customer behavior data from 2018 for Megaline, a telecom operator offering two prepaid plans: Surf and Ultimate. The analysis leverages five datasets to gain insights into customer usage and revenue generation across these plans.

## Objectives:

- To calculate monthly usage metrics including call minutes, text messages, and internet data for each plan.
- To determine the monthly revenue generated by each plan.
- To compare and contrast customer behaviors and plan performance.

## Key Findings

- Surf Plan: It exhibits higher usage overall in terms of call minutes, text messages, and internet data usage. Users on this plan frequently exceed their monthly allowances.
- Ultimate Plan: While it sees less frequent customer usage than the Surf plan, it generates more income per user on average.
